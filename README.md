# Ally-MemoryMirror
What does Memory Mirror (orginally Ally) do?
Memory Mirror is a neuroadaptive cognitive support tool that combines real-time brainwave tracking with adaptive, human-centered experiences to help users monitor cognitive health over time. Unlike traditional assessments that can feel clinical or overwhelming, Memory Mirror is designed to minimize stress, reduce friction, and foster a sense of continuity and support.

Core Features: 
- Real-Time EEG Integration
Continuously streams Emotiv headset data to detect signs of cognitive slowing across frequency bands (↓ α, ↓ β, ↑ θ), enabling proactive support rather than reactive testing.

- Neuro-Gamified Assessment
Replaces rigid clinical evaluations with a 3-Armed Bandit task that assesses reward learning and decision-making in a more intuitive, engaging format—reducing the frustration often linked to conventional cognitive tests.

- Human-Centered Design
Built to feel approachable and affirming. Interfaces and prompts are thoughtfully crafted to minimize cognitive load and help users feel supported, not scrutinized.

- Behavior-Adaptive Monitoring
Dynamically adapts task flow based on ongoing EEG patterns and user performance, ensuring that the experience evolves with the individual rather than imposing static expectations.
